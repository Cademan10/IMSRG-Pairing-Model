Code I developed for obtaining the ground state energy of the nuclear pairing model using the in medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG), located in IMSRG_Flow_Eqs_code.py. 
This same code further contains a numerical solver that obtains an exact solution to the pairing ground state, allowing for comprehensive testing of the IMSRG's accuracy.
I have also included PDF of both the mathematical deriviations needed for the code (contained in SeniorityScheme.pdf), as well as a PDF of a paper and poster I created for presenting this research.
